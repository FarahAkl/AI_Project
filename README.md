### Project Name:
Interactive Map Coloring Tool

### Project Description:
 This project is an interactive tool designed to solve the map coloring problem using 
advanced algorithms such as the Four Color Theorem and Graph Coloring Algorithm . 
Regions or nodes are represented as a graph, and different colors are assigned to each 
region such that no two adjacent regions share the same color. The project provides an 
easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to input data about regions and 
their borders, and automatically generates the coloring. 

### AI Algorithm:
The project utilizes the **Greedy Coloring Algorithm** with the **Largest First strategy** to efficiently assign colors to regions while ensuring that no two adjacent regions have the same color. This algorithm ensures the use of the minimum number of colors possible, adhering to the Four Color Theorem.
