## 🗺 Project Name:

Interactive Map Coloring Tool

## 📌 Project Description:

 This project is an interactive tool designed to solve the map coloring problem using 
advanced algorithms such as the Four Color Theorem and Graph Coloring Algorithm . 
Regions or nodes are represented as a graph, and different colors are assigned to each 
region such that no two adjacent regions share the same color. The project provides an 
easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to input data about regions and 
their borders, and automatically generates the coloring.
